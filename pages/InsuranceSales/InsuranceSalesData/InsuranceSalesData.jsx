                <p>A CRM for insurance software can offer all this and more to help you carve a niche amidst other players. Contact scoring, for instance, helps you identify high-intent leads based on who they are and their engagement with your business. An Insurance CRM likeBottom Funnel Sales assigns each contact a score based on positive and negative signals and also recommends the next best actions to engage with them. </p>
                <p>While we’re on the subject of deals, an insurance CRM software also has a unique ability to track all your deals through a visual sales pipeline. All your deals can be managed in a central location according to your sales process. A single pane view of all your deals and deal stages not only helps you generate a revenue forecast and track the progress made with each of your customers better but also helps you determine where to focus your efforts better.</p>
                <p>In fact, you can also generate daily, weekly, or monthly sales reports to determine the impact of your sales process, and identify strategies to improve your business. Sales reports can help you analyze deals by giving you an insight into won and lost deals, bottlenecks in ongoing deals, the potential value of deals, and more.</p>
