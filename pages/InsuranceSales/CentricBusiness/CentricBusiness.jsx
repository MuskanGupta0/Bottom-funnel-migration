        <h1>The need to build a customer-centric business</h1>
         <p>There are several challenges faced by the global insurance industry today. Firstly, even with the rise of insurance tech companies, the overall technology adoption rate of individual companies and agencies is low. Secondly, insurance is still seen as a ‘commodity’, having minimum engagement with customers. Thirdly, it’s facing increasing competition not just from other insurance players, but also from insurance policy aggregator platforms which seem to take away a major chunk of the standalone company’s customers.</p>
       <p>In such a scenario, today, more than ever, it’s crucial for you, as an insurance salesperson, to evolve from the traditional means of selling to putting a customer at the core of your business, and engaging with them through channels that are most relevant to them. Think email, sales campaigns, social media, and communities.</p>
