            <p>One of the key challenges agencies face is that they often don’t have a separate sales or business development team and a customer servicing team.

Often, the same team that services the customer has to manage sales as well.</p>
            <p>In such a scenario, amidst meeting client deadlines on projects, agencies are also tasked with performing mundane tasks like sending emails, setting reminders to share invoices, following up on payments, and more.</p>
            <p>An advertising and media agency CRM software can reduce the time you invest in such tasks with workflow automation. Using a set of pre-designed action flows, you can automate the most common business activity without having to set up a workflow from scratch. Set up workflows by simply clicking a button or editing an existing template. 

From welcome emails to internal reminders for your team members to complete tasks to sending reminder emails to clients when their contract is up for renewal, a large portion of your tasks can be managed by the system while you focus on servicing your customers better. </p>
