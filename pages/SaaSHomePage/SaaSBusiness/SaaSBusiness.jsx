                The rise of the SaaS industry
            </h1>
            <p>Software as a Service (SaaS) has become the ideal software model for businesses in recent years. According to Gartner, SaaS is expected to be a $120 billion industry by 2021. </p>
             <p>Adding to that, recent research finds that almost 73% of organizations will be using SaaS applications by 2021 as well. 

As an industry, SaaS is only set to expand further in the future. While the future growth is positively exciting in this sector, with over 10,000 SaaS businesses in the world today, the competition is fierce. This makes it difficult for businesses to stand out in a crowded market.</p>
        <p>According to a survey conducted by Invesp, over 89% of SaaS businesses treat “New Customer Acquisition” as their highest growth priority, 59% treat “Existing Customer Renewals” and 46% treat upselling as high priority. 

For SaaS businesses like yours to thrive in this competition, you need to conquer two major challenges—customer acquisition and customer retention.</p>
        <h4>But, how?</h4>
       
        <p>The best way is to adopt a CRM solution for your SaaS business.</p>

             <h2>CRM software—how important it is for your SaaS business</h2>
            <p>Customer acquisition is the driver of SaaS businesses. Driving leads to the bottom of the sales funnel and converting them into customers is not a bed of roses. It’s a complex mission for sales teams to prospect, follow-up, nurture, and sell. Add to this, sales reps also have to deal with upselling and retention.</p>
            <p>In a market full of growing SaaS products, your business could be neck and neck with competitors. But, how do you compete and win more customers? Customer experience is the real differentiator. The upside here? Providing excellent customer experience in the SaaS business is easy with CRM software. Well, only with a good one.</p>
            <p>CRM comes in all shapes and sizes. But the right CRM should facilitate your sales process from the first touch point to the final sale.</p>
